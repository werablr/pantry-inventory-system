## 9 July 2025 ‚Äì Scanner Project Progress Log

### üß† Project Prompt / Memory Scaffolding

This section establishes persistent context for the Scanner Project orchestrator system.

#### ‚úÖ Scope & Architecture
- The system coordinates multi-step AI workflows for barcode + OCR-based nutrition scanning.
- Prompt chaining is handled via the `prompt_chaining_map` Supabase table.
- Prompts are version-controlled in `agent_prompts` and resolved dynamically at runtime.
- Claude executes AI logic; ChatGPT verifies outputs and manages logs/terminal; Gemini is sandboxed.
- Supabase is the single source of truth (SSOT).
- Claude and orchestrator call real APIs (e.g. Nutritionix) based on barcode input.
- All fallback logic must degrade gracefully with JSON output (never crash).

#### üß© Workflow Protocol
- Phase-based execution:
  - **Phase 1**: Prompt scaffolding, chain setup
  - **Phase 2**: Barcode processing + context loading + Nutritionix
  - **Phase 3**: Save result to DB
  - **Phase 4**: Metrics + review flags
- Each phase must pass structured JSON from one step to the next.
- Claude must return machine-readable JSON, no explanations.
- If critical data is missing, fallback prompt chain must be triggered (e.g., manual entry).

#### üõ°Ô∏è Environment / Keys
- `.env` contains keys:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID`, `NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY`
- Service keys must **never** be used in frontend or mobile.

#### üìè Operational Rules (from 8 July + earlier logs)
- All output must be verifiable (no guessing).
- Supabase tables must have RLS enabled + appropriate read policies.
- Chaining logic must remain in Supabase ‚Äî not hardcoded.
- Logging must capture terminal, Claude, and ChatGPT actions with source attribution.
- Logs should be appendable and stored in plain text for durability.
- Use fallback chaining if any required step fails.

---

### ‚úÖ Progress
- Resolved RLS issue blocking project metadata in Supabase.
- Successfully retrieved project metadata, project logs, and triggered fallback chaining.
- Implemented Nutritionix API lookup logic in `scanner_foundation_orchestrator.js`.
- Verified Phase 2.3 completes with real API call and fallback strategy logic.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges
- Supabase returned 0 rows for valid project ID due to missing read access.
- Role-based access policy (`anon`) prevented metadata fetch until universal read was temporarily granted.
- Nutritionix API chain was stuck at ‚Äúpending‚Äù due to lack of actual API execution logic.

### üõ†Ô∏è Actions Taken
- Inserted debug RPC in orchestrator to log current Supabase session role.
- Confirmed missing policy, inserted temporary universal read policy for `projects` table.
- After successful retrieval, reverted policy to restrict to `authenticated` role.
- Added conditional logic in orchestrator to perform live Nutritionix API lookup and return structured results.

### üìè Rules / Protocols
- All orchestrator logic must fail forward using defined fallback steps.
- Logs should be recorded in plain text for traceability, with agent outputs captured verbatim.
- All .env API keys must be separated by environment: `NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY`, etc.
- Prompt chaining rules are controlled via `prompt_chaining_map`, not hardcoded conditionals.

üîí Policy Update ‚Äì No Forward Progress Without Resolution

As of 9 July 2025, the following rule is now in effect:

‚ÄúAll errors, failures, and ambiguous results must be fixed at the root. No fallback chaining or error bypassing is allowed.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	All fallback prompts (e.g., Manual Entry, Generic Creation) are now gated.
	‚Ä¢	Workflow execution will hard-fail on incomplete or partial AI output.
	‚Ä¢	Claude‚Äôs responses must be complete, structured, and valid before chaining.
	‚Ä¢	This ensures a permanent fix is applied before further development or logging.

‚∏ª

Please paste that at the bottom of the docs/9 July Log.txt file in VS Code.

Once pasted, confirm and I‚Äôll proceed under this policy with zero tolerance for unresolved errors.

### üö´ Policy Reinforcement ‚Äì No Forward Progress Without Resolution

As of 9 July 2025, this policy is active and supersedes any fallback-first logic:

‚ÄúAll errors, failures, and ambiguous results must be fixed at the root. No fallback chaining or error bypassing is allowed.‚Äù

- All fallback prompts (e.g., Manual Entry, Generic Creation) are now gated.
- Workflow execution must **fail hard** on incomplete or partial AI output.
- Claude‚Äôs responses must be complete, structured, and valid before chaining.
- If any required data is missing or unclear, execution halts until the issue is resolved.
- This ensures permanent resolution and prevents downstream corruption or tech debt.
