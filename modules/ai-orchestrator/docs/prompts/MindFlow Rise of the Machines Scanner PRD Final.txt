Here is the final Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your scanner app project. It consolidates and refines content from the draft and aligns with best practices for modular, AI-coordinated systems.

üßæ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project ID: food_scanner
Version: v1.1
Owner: Brian Rogers
Created By: ChatGPT (Finalized based on v1.0 by Claude)
Last Updated: 2025-07-03

‚∏ª

1. üìå Objective

Develop a mobile-first Nutrition Scanner app that enables barcode-based food identification and OCR-driven expiration date capture, storing results in Supabase. It will feature intelligent manual review workflows, offline queueing, and integration with Nutritionix. LangChain will orchestrate backend logic and AI agents.

‚∏ª

2. üë• Target Users
	‚Ä¢	Primary: Brian Rogers
	‚Ä¢	Secondary (future scope): Household users, dieticians, home inventory apps

‚∏ª

3. üß† Functional Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Scan food product barcodes
	‚Ä¢	Fetch product metadata from Nutritionix
	‚Ä¢	Use OCR to extract expiration dates from packaging
	‚Ä¢	Store results in Supabase: product_id, expiration_date, ocr_confidence, scan_id
	‚Ä¢	Allow user review and editing before final save
	‚Ä¢	Tag each scan (e.g., scan_143)
	‚Ä¢	Provide retry and OCR skip options
	‚Ä¢	Filter and search existing scan logs by product or date

‚∏ª

4. üõ°Ô∏è Non-Functional Requirements
	‚Ä¢	API call response time <1500 ms on 4G
	‚Ä¢	OCR confidence thresholds adjustable by user
	‚Ä¢	Offline queueing for unsaved scan events
	‚Ä¢	Versioned, stateless API architecture
	‚Ä¢	No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stored
	‚Ä¢	Claude used once for static document parsing only
	‚Ä¢	All backend operations modular and portable
	‚Ä¢	App must function fully in low-connectivity mode (excluding Nutritionix lookups)

‚∏ª

5. üß± System Components

Component	Owner	Description
Supabase DB	ChatGPT Agent	Structured backend for scan metadata, products, OCR logs
Claude Agent	Claude	Initial PRD/document extractor (used once)
ChatGPT Agent	ChatGPT	Backend developer: DB schema, API, validators
Gemini/Perplexity	Validator Agents	External QA for schema, logic, and documentation
LangChain Server	Localhost	Orchestration layer for memory and agent task routing
iPhone App	Code Claude	Mobile interface: barcode, OCR, API interaction


‚∏ª

6. üß™ Acceptance Criteria
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Barcode scan matches Nutritionix product with ‚â•90% confidence
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ OCR result is auto-saved or reviewed by user
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Manual edit supported for expiration before saving
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Supabase logs contain full metadata: product_id, expiration_date, confidence, scan_id
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ API calls return in under 1.5 seconds
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Skip button functions correctly for OCR fallback
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Schema/API verified by external LLMs

‚∏ª

7. üìÑ Deliverables (under projects/food_scanner/v1.1/)
	‚Ä¢	prd.md ‚Äì This document
	‚Ä¢	schema.sql ‚Äì Supabase table definitions
	‚Ä¢	api_endpoints.json ‚Äì REST/RPC interface specs
	‚Ä¢	frontend_spec.md ‚Äì Mobile integration and screen flow
	‚Ä¢	workflow.yaml ‚Äì LangChain agent/task definitions
	‚Ä¢	qa_feedback.md ‚Äì Validator comments and test results
	‚Ä¢	test_data.json ‚Äì Sample scan inputs and edge cases

‚∏ª

8. ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints & Assumptions
	‚Ä¢	Supabase is the sole database platform
	‚Ä¢	LangChain server is hosted on a MacBook (localhost)
	‚Ä¢	Claude will not be reused after PRD generation
	‚Ä¢	Terminal-based operations executed only by ChatGPT
	‚Ä¢	iOS-only release for MVP
	‚Ä¢	OCR must work with low-resolution expiration stamps
	‚Ä¢	Logging must support scan replay for audit/debug

‚∏ª

9. ‚úÖ Verification Plan
	‚Ä¢	Gemini: Validate database normalization and API consistency
	‚Ä¢	Perplexity: Confirm business logic clarity and architecture
	‚Ä¢	ChatGPT: Run local tests, schema migrations, and code linting
	‚Ä¢	Manual QA: Run on-device scan test scenarios with OCR fails/success/skips

Save options:
Would you like me to save this PRD as:
	‚Ä¢	prd.md (for version control),
	‚Ä¢	prd.txt (for Claude parsing),
	‚Ä¢	or both?

And should I generate the scaffolding folder now with all placeholder files (schema.sql, etc.) based on this PRD?
