🧾 Product Requirement Document (PRD)

Project ID: food_scanner
Version: v1.0
Owner: Brian Rogers
Created By: Claude (Initial Extractor)
Last Updated: 2025-07-03

⸻

1. 📌 Objective

Create a mobile-first Nutrition Scanner application that allows users to scan food items via barcode and extract expiration dates via OCR, storing results in a Supabase database. The app will support intelligent review workflows and integrate with Nutritionix for product identification.

⸻

2. 👥 Target Users
	•	Primary: Brian

⸻

3. 🧠 Functional Requirements
	•	Scan product barcodes and fetch product metadata from Nutritionix
	•	Trigger OCR to extract expiration dates from product packaging
	•	Store product info, scan metadata, and expiration data in Supabase
	•	Support manual review/edit of scan results before saving
	•	Allow scan retries or OCR skips
	•	Tag and version each scan event (e.g., scan_143)

⸻

4. 🛡️ Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Response time <1500 ms per operation on 4G
	•	OCR confidence thresholds must be user-adjustable
	•	Must support offline queueing for failed uploads
	•	API endpoints must be versioned and stateless
	•	No personally identifiable information (PII) stored
	•	Claude used only once for doc parsing; all other operations modular

⸻

5. 🧱 System Components

Component	Owner	Description
Supabase DB	ChatGPT Agent	Core structured backend for scans, products, OCR logs
Claude Agent	Claude	Extracts PRD and backend specs from documents
ChatGPT Agent	ChatGPT	Builds backend code, API endpoints, and validators
Gemini/Perplexity	Validator Agents	Review schema, API, and system logic
LangChain Server	Localhost	Orchestrates agents, stores project memory and artifacts
iPhone App	Code Claude	Captures scans, connects to API, displays product/expiration


⸻

6. 🧪 Acceptance Criteria
	•	✅ Successful barcode scan returns Nutritionix product within 90% match
	•	✅ OCR result auto-saved or flagged for review
	•	✅ User can manually edit expiration date before save
	•	✅ Supabase stores: product_id, expiration_date, ocr_confidence, scan_id
	•	✅ API calls return within 1.5 seconds under test conditions
	•	✅ Final database schema and endpoints reviewed by Gemini

⸻

7. 📄 Deliverables

Expected artifacts to be versioned under projects/food_scanner/v1.0/:
	•	schema.sql – Supabase table definitions
	•	api_endpoints.json – REST or RPC interface contracts
	•	frontend_spec.md – UI integration details
	•	prd.md – This document
	•	workflow.yaml – LangChain handoff config
	•	qa_feedback.md – Validation notes from ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.

⸻

8. ⚙️ Constraints & Assumptions
	•	Supabase is the only backend database in use
	•	LangChain server is hosted locally on MacBook
	•	Claude has no persistent memory and is used once per project
	•	All terminal commands are executed by ChatGPT
	•	OCR fallback must support full bypass (“Skip” option)

⸻

9. ✅ Verification Plan

Tag: VERIFY WITH EXTERNAL AIs
	•	Gemini: Validate schema normalization and endpoint contracts
	•	Perplexity: Confirm API consistency and logic clarity
	•	ChatGPT: Execute terminal-based Supabase migration and test queries

	•	or both?

Also, do you want the scaffold generator next to set up this project folder automatically with this PRD embedded?

Here is a **production-ready Product Requirement Document (PRD)** template tailored for your scanner requirement, based directly on the provided reference[1]:

**🧾 Product Requirement Document (PRD)**

**Project ID:** food_scanner  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Owner:** Brian Rogers  
**Created By:** Claude (Initial Extractor)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-03

**1. Objective**

Develop a **mobile-first Nutrition Scanner application** that enables users to scan food items via barcode, extract expiration dates using OCR, and store all results in a Supabase database. The app will feature intelligent review workflows and integrate with Nutritionix for product identification[1].

**2. Target Users**

- **Primary:** Brian

**3. Functional Requirements**

- Scan product barcodes and retrieve metadata from Nutritionix
- Use OCR to extract expiration dates from product packaging
- Store product info, scan metadata, and expiration data in Supabase
- Allow manual review and editing of scan results before saving
- Support scan retries or OCR skips
